About Project- This for Learning Purpose
Creating an email verifier tool in Go involves using libraries such as net and net/smtp. This tool will perform basic email verification, such as:

1.Syntax validation: Ensures the email format is correct.
2.Domain MX record check: Verifies the domain has a valid Mail Exchange (MX) record.
3.SMTP handshake: Connects to the domain's mail server to validate the email.
